# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```python
def createlist(n):
    l=[]
    for i in range(2,n):
        if i%2==0:
            l.append(i)
    print("List =",l)
    print("Sum of the list = ",sum(l))

```

## Output

## Result

Thus the program executed successfully.
